1. Create `cursor` directory and `test.txt` file
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~$ mkdir cursor
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~$ touch test.txt


2. Copy `test.txt` file to `cursor` directory
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~$ cp test.txt cursor


3. List the files in the current directory, in “long listing format”.
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~$ ls -l cursor

4. List all files, including hidden files, in the your home (~) directory, in reverse alphabetical order and long listing format.
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~$ ls -lar ~

5*. Rename the file `test.txt` to `new_test.txt` and then create one more `empty_file.txt`
Hint: Renaming is done using the same command as moving.
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~$ mv test.txt new_test.txt
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~$ touch empty_file.txt

6. Delete the files empty_file.txt and new_test.txt. Note that your answer must be a single command and not multiple commands.
Hint: Many commands can accept more than one parameter.
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~$ rm empty_file.txt new_test.txt
	
Create hw.txt file under cursor directory
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~$ touch cursor/hw.txt

7*. Set the file hw.txt to have a last-modified date of January 1, 2020, 4:15am.
Hint: The man page for the proper command describes the timestamp 'STAMP' format to use. Look for this!
Also note: Linux is case-sensitive when you are specifying file or directory names.
You can use a * (asterisk) as a “wild-card” character to specify a group of files.
For example, *foo means all files whose names end with foo, and foo* means all files whose names begin with foo.
You can use a wildcard in the middle of a file name, such as foo*bar for all files that start with foo and end with bar.
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~/cursor$ touch -m -t 202001010415 hw.txt
	
Create hw.sh, hw1.sh, hw2.sh, hw1.txt under the cursor directory
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~/cursor$ touch hw.sh hw1.sh hw2.sh hw1.txt
	
8. List all files (only with the extension .sh) in the current directory.
Note that the ls command can accept more than one parameter for what files you want it to list.
Hint: Use grep
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~/cursor$ ls |grep .sh

9. Copy all the text files (files whose names end with .txt) from the current folder to the new directory `text_files`.
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~/cursor$ mkdir text_files
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~/cursor$ cp *.txt text_files
	

10. Write `cursor` to the hw.txt file by using echo.
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~/cursor$ echo 'cursor'> hw.txt
11. Display the contents of hw.txt
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~/cursor$ cat hw.txt

12. Change the permissions to 0 for current user and try to Display contents again.
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~/cursor$ chmod 000 hw.txt
	---------- 1 rrudyk rrudyk 7 чер 24 22:18 hw.txt

13. Change the permission to rwx for current user only and try again.
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~/cursor$ chmod 700 hw.txt
	-rwxrwxrwx 1 rrudyk rrudyk 7 чер 24 22:18 hw.txt*

14. Write from 1 to 10 in each line in hw.txt by using text reader.
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~/cursor$ seq 10 >hw.txt

🔍 Self Discovery: The head and tail commands output only the first or last few lines (respectively) of a file to the terminal.

15. Display only the first 7 lines of the file hw.txt from the current directory on the terminal.
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~$ head -n 7 cursor/hw.txt
	
16*. Create test.sh with echo 'Hello' and make it executable
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~/cursor$  touch test.sh
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~/cursor$ echo "echo 'Hello'" > test.sh
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~/cursor$ sudo chmod 554 test.sh

17*. Execute test.sh
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~/cursor$ ./test.sh

18. Search for a files with .sh in your working directory.
	rrudyk@rrudyk-ZenBook-UX425IA-UM425IA:~/cursor$ find *.sh
